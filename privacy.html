        <h1>Privacy Policy for RepSnap</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 4th 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to RepSnap! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.</p>

        <h2>1. Collection of Your Information</h2>
        <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the App depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> Personally identifiable information, such as your [e.g., name, email address], that you voluntarily give to us when choosing to participate in various activities related to the App, such as [e.g., account registration, feedback submission].</li>
            <li><strong>Workout Data:</strong> Information related to your workouts logged within the App, such as exercise types, repetitions, sets, weight used, timestamps, session duration, and any photos you associate with sessions. This data is stored locally on your device and may be synced using Apple's CloudKit for backup and cross-device access if you are logged into iCloud.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information automatically collected when you access the App, such as your device type, operating system, IP address (if applicable through external services), actions you take within the App, and the dates and times of your access. This data is generally anonymized and used for analytics and improving the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Purchase Information:</strong> If you subscribe to RepSnap Premium, transaction details are processed and managed by Apple through the App Store. We receive confirmation of your subscription status but do not directly collect or store your payment card details.</li>
            <li><strong>Data from CloudKit:</strong> If you enable iCloud syncing, your workout data is stored in your private CloudKit database, managed by Apple. We access this data solely to provide the App's functionality (syncing, backup). We do not access or use this data for other purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Use of Your Information</h2>
        <p>Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the App to:</p>

            <li>Create and manage your account (if applicable).</li>
            <li>Provide the core functionality of tracking and displaying your workout statistics.</li>
            <li>Sync your data across devices via CloudKit (if enabled).</li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>CloudKit Storage:</strong> Workout data synced via iCloud is stored in your private CloudKit container managed by Apple. Apple's privacy policy governs their handling of this data. We do not share this data with other third parties.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics Providers:</strong> We may use third-party service providers (e.g., Firebase Analytics, Apple App Analytics) to monitor and analyze the use of our App. These providers use collected data to track and monitor the usage of our App. This data may be shared with other services of these providers. This data is typically aggregated and anonymized.</li>
            <li><strong>By Law or to Protect Rights:</strong> If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.</li>
             <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Security of Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. Workout data is primarily stored locally on your device and, if enabled, within your private CloudKit container protected by Apple's security measures. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>

            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete individual sessions or exercises within the App. Deleting the App will remove locally stored data. Data synced to CloudKit can be managed through your iCloud account settings or by contacting Apple support.</li>
